# AI Learning Organizer

Forward TikToks, articles, and links from your iPhone. Get organized, step-by-step AI learning tutorials on a shareable blog.

## Status: Planning Phase

See [PLANNING.md](./PLANNING.md) for the full planning document with questions to answer before building.

## How It Will Work

1. **Share a link** from your iPhone (via text, iOS Shortcut, or email)
2. **Content is extracted** automatically (video transcripts, article text, etc.)
3. **AI processes it** into a structured, step-by-step tutorial
4. **Published** to your personal evergreen blog site you can share with friends
