Vibe Coding: Build Real Apps Without Writing Code

How tools like Lovable, v0, and Bolt let you describe an app and get a working prototype in minutes. This is L2 — you design, AI builds.

What is vibe coding?

Vibe coding is describing what you want in natural language and having AI generate a working application. You're the designer; AI is the builder. That's the L2 relationship.

The tools.

Lovable.

Full-stack app generation from a description. Handles frontend, backend, database, and deployment. Best for: complete web apps with authentication and data.

v0 by Vercel.

UI component generation with React/Next.js. Best for: frontend components, landing pages, design system pieces.

Bolt.

Rapid prototyping with live preview. Best for: quick iterations, exploring ideas visually.

Replit.

Full development environment with AI assistance. Best for: when you want to see and edit the code alongside the AI.

The L2 mindset.

At L2, you stop doing the work and start specifying the work. Your value is clarity — knowing what you want built, not how to build it. The clearer your spec, the better the output.

What L2 gets you.

SHOW IT. Prototypes, demos, proof of concepts. You can go from idea to clickable demo in an afternoon. That's a competitive advantage most people haven't realized yet.
