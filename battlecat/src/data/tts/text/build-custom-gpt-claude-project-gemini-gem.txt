Build Your First Custom GPT, Claude Project, or Gemini Gem

Stop repeating yourself every conversation. This step-by-step guide walks you through building personalized AI assistants on all three major platforms — the single biggest upgrade from L0 to L1.

You're Wasting 30% of Every AI Conversation.

Every time you open a new chat and type "I'm a marketing manager at a SaaS startup, I need..." — you've already lost. That context you just typed? The AI forgets it the moment you close the tab. You're at L0: Asker. The AI is a stranger every single time.

The jump from L0 to L1 isn't about learning a new tool. It's about teaching AI who you are — once — so it never forgets.

Why This Matters.

Custom GPTs, Claude Projects, and Gemini Gems are the same concept on three platforms: a persistent AI assistant pre-loaded with your context. Your role, your industry, your preferences, your communication style, your recurring tasks. Set it up once, use it forever.

The people who've made this jump report getting 2-3x better outputs immediately. Not because the AI got smarter — because it finally knows who it's talking to.

How to Build One on Each Platform.

Custom GPTs (ChatGPT Plus).

- Click Explore GPTs in the sidebar, then + Create
- In the Configure tab, write instructions that cover:
- Who you are (role, industry, company size)
- How you want responses formatted (bullet points? paragraphs? with examples?)
- What the GPT should never do (no generic advice, no fluff)
- Upload any reference documents — style guides, SOPs, product docs
- Add Prompt Starters like "Draft a customer email about..." or "Analyze this competitor's landing page"
- Test it with real tasks, refine the instructions, repeat

Pro tip: Use the RODES framework — Role, Objective, Details, Examples, Sense Check. Start every instruction set with who the GPT is and what it's trying to achieve.

Claude Projects.

- Open claude.ai, click Projects in the sidebar, then New Project
- Set a Project Name and write detailed Project Instructions
- Upload files directly — Claude can reference PDFs, docs, spreadsheets, codebases
- Every conversation within the project inherits the full context
- Use it for ongoing work: weekly reports, content calendars, code reviews

Gemini Gems.

- In gemini.google.com, find Gems in the sidebar
- Click Create Gem and define the persona
- Add behavioral instructions and knowledge context
- Gems integrate with Google Workspace — they can reference your Drive, Docs, and Sheets

The Grocery Test.

Here's how you know it's working: ask your custom AI to make you a grocery list.

- L0 response: Generic list of common items
- L1 response: Knows you're vegetarian, shops at Trader Joe's, cooks for two, avoids gluten, and always needs more coffee

If your AI can't pass this test, your instructions aren't specific enough.

Common Mistakes.

- Too vague: "Be helpful and professional" tells the AI nothing. Instead: "You are a content strategist for B2B SaaS. Write in a direct, confident tone. Use bullet points. Always include 3 specific examples."
- Too restrictive: Don't micromanage every response format. Give personality and constraints, not scripts.
- No examples: Include 2-3 examples of ideal outputs in your instructions. This is the single most effective technique.

The Bottom Line.

Building a Custom GPT, Claude Project, or Gemini Gem takes 15 minutes. The time you save over the next month will be measured in hours. This is the easiest, highest-ROI level-up in the entire AI Maturity Framework. Do it today.
