What Is Prompt Engineering and Why Should You Care?

A beginner-friendly breakdown of how the words you type into AI tools shape the quality of what you get back. Start here if you're new to AI.

The basics.

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting your input to an AI model so it produces better, more useful output. Think of it like learning to ask better questions — the better you ask, the better the answer.

Why it matters.

Most people type a vague sentence into ChatGPT and get a vague answer back. That's L0 behavior — transactional, no context, no continuity. Understanding prompts is the first step to getting real value from AI.

Key techniques.

- Be specific: "Write a 3-paragraph summary of X for a non-technical audience" beats "Tell me about X"

- Give context: Tell the AI who you are and what you need the output for

- Use examples: Show the AI what good output looks like

- Iterate: Your first prompt is rarely your best — refine and ask again

The L0 to L1 bridge.

Once you understand prompts, the natural next step is to stop repeating yourself. That's where custom instructions and memory come in — the jump from L0 (Asker) to L1 (Instructor).
