Custom GPTs and AI Memory: Stop Repeating Yourself

How to use Custom GPTs, Claude Projects, and memory features to create AI assistants that already know who you are and what you need.

The problem with starting over.

Every time you open a new chat, you lose all context. You re-explain your role, your preferences, your constraints. That's wasted time and worse output. This is the L0 trap.

Level 1: Teach the AI who you are.

L1 is about giving up anonymity and investing time to teach the AI about you. The payoff is massive — responses that actually fit your situation without you having to explain it every time.

How to do it.

Custom GPTs (OpenAI).

Create a GPT pre-loaded with your context: role, industry, communication style, common tasks. Share it with your team or keep it private.

Claude Projects.

Upload documents, set project instructions, and chat within a persistent context. Claude remembers the project scope across conversations.

The Grocery Test.

Ask your AI to make you a grocery list. If it gives you a generic list, you're at L0. If it knows you're vegetarian, shop at Trader Joe's, and cook for two — that's L1.

What you give up.

Anonymity. You have to share real information about yourself. But the trade is worth it: AI that actually helps instead of generically responds.
